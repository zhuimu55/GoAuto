### 催款邮件的最后通牒

**Example 1:**

```plaintext
Dear Henry,

We are really surprised that we haven’t got your overdue payment till now. We pushed you again and again in the past two weeks.

Please settle the payment within this week without any further delay.

Yours sincerely,
Lucia
```

**Example 2:**

```plaintext
Henry,

What happened for the payment??? You should have arranged the wire transfer 14 days ago!

We really think that you are an honest guy. And we treasure our business relationship with personal friendship.

Please realize our position and balance the payment AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.

Yours sincerely,
Lucia
```

**Example 3:**

```plaintext
HENRY,

We are unable to understand why we have received no reply and no payment yet till now. 
We feel that we have shown reasonable patience and treated you a long overdue period. We cannot afford any delay at the moment.

Please reply us immediately for balancing the payment. If not, we have to take action in law and report this claim to the insurance company.

Lucia
