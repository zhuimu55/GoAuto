### 慎用 "Of course":

在邮件中使用 "Of course" 可能会显得过于随意或缺乏礼貌，因为对方无法感受到语气。建议使用以下替代表达：  
- Sure  
- Certainly  
- No problem  
- You bet (口语)  

**例子**

1. Could you send me the offer sheet in advance?  
   == Of course!  

2. Please pick up from the hotel at 9 A.M.  
   == Of course we will.  

3. I’m afraid your offer is too expensive.  
   == Of course! But...  

4. I really love your item, even though the pricing is a little bit expensive.  
   == Yeah, of course we are glad to hear that. Thank you!  

### 谨慎"My understanding is "

 "My understanding is " 潜台词“你的说法都是错的“，我的理解才是对的。可能带有否定对方观点的意味，建议使用更委婉的表达方式。
 
**正确表达法**

1. Would you like us to...?  
2. I’m puzzled about your request. Is it...?  
3. We’re a little confused about the issue you mentioned. Could you please clarify it?  
4. Is it correct? Am I right?  
5. Sorry, I’m afraid I don’t get your point very clearly. Could you please explain it?  
6. Do you mean..., please?
